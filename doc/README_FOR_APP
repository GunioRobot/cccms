CCCMS


The basic structure of the cccms is built from Nodes. Nodes live within a 
nested set. When a arbitrary url is entered it is dispatched to the
ContentController action render_page. Based on the url parameters the
render_page action retrieves the corresponding Node from the database. Rather
than walking through the tree of the nested set to find the node, the Node is
retrieved directly by its unique_name which matches the url parameters.
